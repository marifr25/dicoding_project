# ‚öΩ European Football Players Clustering
## üß† Project Overview
This notebook contains a clustering analysis of football player statistics in major European leagues (season 2024‚Äì2025).
## üéØ Objectives
- Conducting exploration on the ‚ÄúFootball Players Stats (2024‚Äì2025)‚Äù dataset downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
- Building a clustering model using K-Means both before and after dimensionality reduction with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to group players based on their statistical similarities.
- Exploring cluster quality through Silhouette Score, Elbow Method metrics, and visualizations.
- Analyze and interpret each cluster to understand the characteristics of player data in each cluster.
## üìÅ Dataset & References
- [Football Players Stats (2024-2025)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hubertsidorowicz/football-players-stats-2024-2025)
- [Football players visualization](https://www.kaggle.com/code/quangnhatbui/football-players-visualization)
## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Missing value and duplication analysis
  - Distribution and correlation analysis
  - Data visualization
- Data Preprocessing
  - Handling missing values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom previous analysis results by dropping, in goalkeeper statistics it will be filled with a value of 0
  - Handling duplicate data by adopting from notebook [Football players visualization](https://www.kaggle.com/code/quangnhatbui/football-players-visualization)
  - Feature normalization using MinMax Scaling
- Clustering Model Development
  - At the beginning I need to do a Silhouette Score visualization first to determine the right number of clusters.
  - Then train and predict the data using K-Means Clustering.
  - Evaluate model with Silhouette Score.
  - The silhouette score obtained was around 0.3. Then re-cluster using the Elbow Method
  - Evaluation results up to around 0.5, but this result still can't get close to 0.7, so then I will do Feature Selection
  - Evaluation results up to around 0.6, then use Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
    - First of all visualize the PCA Cumulative Variance
    - Then fit transform PCA
    - Evaluation results are not much different from before, but after this the PCA results will be used.
  - Visualize Clustering results using bar charts, heatmaps, and radar charts
- Cluster Results Analysis and Interpretation
  - Creating a profile for each cluster
  - Analysis of feature contributions to each PCA component
  - analysis of the range of values ‚Äã‚Äã(min, max, mean, and std) of PCA components for each cluster and position
  - Interpret the target
